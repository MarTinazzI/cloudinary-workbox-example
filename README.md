# Adaptive image caching based on network speed with Workbox.js

In order to install the dependencies please execute `npm i` from the project folder.

Once the dependencies have been installed, please run `gulp` (if you don't have gulp installed on your system please install it: `npm i gulp -g`)

After executing `gulp` the application is built and it is placed under the `build` folder. Serve the contents of that folder to see the final solution (for example by executing: `npx http-server build`)
